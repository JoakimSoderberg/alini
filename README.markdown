alini
=====

alini is a simple parser for INI files written in C.

Usage
-----

alini is generally used this way:

1. Create a parser using `alini_parser_create()`.
2. Set the callback that will be called when a key/value pair is found using
   `alini_parser_setcallback_foundkvpair()`.
3. Start the parser using `alini_parser_start()`.
4. Cleanup by disposing the parser using `alini_parser_dispose()`.

A simple example is provided in `main.c`.

To "step" the parser, i.e. have it parse the next key/value pair and call the
callback, use `alini_parser_step()`. Generally, this should not be necessary;
you can always use `alini_parser_start()` instead.

To stop the parsing process, use `alini_parser_halt()`. No further callbacks
will be called.

The parser should not be disposed in a callback method; it should instead be
deallocated afterwards.
